# SpotiPlayer Rewrite
 A Spotify Mobile lookalike skin for Rainmeter.

## What is it?

SpotiPlayer was a project I initially embarked on back in September of 2019, and it grew to be my most popular creation. I give it a lot of updates in February of 2020, releasing it as version 2.0, and haven't touched it sense. I've gained a bunch of new knowledge, so I figured it's time to rebuild SpotiPlayer from the ground up, with optimization and usability in mind. 

## How can I get it?

You can download releases of SpotiPlayer Rewrite from the Releases Tab, or clone the repository into your Rainmeter folder through GitHub Desktop.

Note that cloning the repo directly could lead to unforeseen consequences due to the fact that you're downloading the most current developmental version of the skin, with every bug I've yet to fix.

## More Info

This skin is still in development, so there isn't much more to show. 

If you want to follow the skin's development, I'll be covering each step I take in my Discord server, which you can join by clicking [here](https://discordapp.com/invite/72GZGN3).
